**Effective date:** September 28, 2025  
**App:** WholeTemple (iOS)  
**Developer:** Dan Negussie  
**Contact:** wholetemple25@gmail.com

## 1. Overview
WholeTemple is a personal wellness app. I collect and use only the data needed to provide core features (account, preferences, rituals/reflections, optional in-app tips).  
I do **not** sell your data or use third-party advertising SDKs.

---

## 2. Information Collected
- **Account Information**: email address, hashed password, and internal user ID.  
- **App Content You Add**: reflections, ritual selections, preferences, and similar content created in the app.  
- **Purchase Information (Tip Jar)**: purchase identifiers and receipts provided by Apple for validation. Payment details are never shared with me.  
- **Device/Usage Data (Minimal)**: technical data from Firebase/Apple services (e.g., timestamps, request logs). No precise location is collected.

---

## 3. Use of Information
- To create and maintain your account.  
- To operate core features (ritual tracking, reflections, preferences).  
- To process optional tips via Apple’s in-app purchase system.  
- To secure the service, prevent abuse, and comply with legal obligations.

---

## 4. Payments
All payments are processed by **Apple In-App Purchase**.  
Apple provides transaction status and receipts, but I do not receive or store card numbers or Apple Pay details.

---

## 5. Data Sharing
I do not sell or rent your data. Information is shared only with:  
- **Google Firebase/Cloud Functions/Firestore** (hosting, storage, server logic).  
- **Apple** (App Store, TestFlight, In-App Purchase processing).  
These providers act on my instructions and use safeguards.

---

## 6. Data Retention
- Account data and reflections are retained while your account is active.  
- You may request deletion at any time (see Section 10).  
- Limited records may be kept if required by law, security, or dispute resolution.

---

## 7. Data Security
Industry-standard protections are used, including encrypted transport (HTTPS/TLS) and restricted database access. No method is 100% secure, but I take reasonable steps to protect your data.

---

## 8. Children’s Privacy
WholeTemple is not directed to children under 13.  
If I learn that a child under 13 has provided personal information, I will delete it.

---

## 9. International Users
Data may be processed and stored in the United States (and other regions where Firebase operates).  
By using the app, you consent to this transfer.

---

## 10. Your Choices and Rights
- **Access/Update**: update your account info in the app.  
- **Deletion**: request deletion of your account and data by contacting **wholetemple25@gmail.com**.  
- **Opt-Out**: the Tip Jar is optional; the app works fully without purchases.

---

## 11. Changes to This Policy
I may update this policy as the app evolves.  
New versions will be posted with updated effective dates and, when required, in-app or email notifications.
